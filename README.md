# Java TestingPair Opener README

This is an extension that opens JavaCode's TestingPair with a shortcut-key.

## Features

This extension adds "Open Testing Pair" to your keyboard shortcuts.
The default shortcut key is Ctrl + 9.
Executing "Open Testing Pair" opens Java TestingPair.

For example, if you open the class "com.example.demo.DemoRepository.java" at "src/main/java" in editor, 
It will open "com.example.demo.DemoRepositoryTest" at "src/test/java".
Conversely, if you open the test class and run it, the implementation class will be opened.

If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically.
